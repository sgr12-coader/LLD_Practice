# Behavioral Design Patterns
The Behavioral Design Patterns are a family of design patterns that deal with how objects interact and communicate with each other. They focus on improving the flexibility, reusability, and maintainability of your code by addressing common communication and collaboration patterns.

## Key Characteristics:

* Object Interaction: These patterns focus on how objects interact and collaborate with each other.
* Flexibility: They make your code more adaptable to changes by providing mechanisms for flexible communication and collaboration.
* Reusability: They promote code reuse by encapsulating common interaction patterns.
* Maintainability: They improve the maintainability of your code by making it easier to understand and modify.

## Common Behavioral Patterns:

1. Chain of Responsibility: Passes a request along a chain of objects until an object handles it.
2. Command: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests.
3. Iterator: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its internal representation.
4. Mediator: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
5. Observer: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. Â  
6. State: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
7. Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
8. Template Method: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. 
9. Visitor: Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. 
10. Memento: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that it can be restored later.
11. Interpreter: Defines a grammar for interpreting a language and provides a way to evaluate sentences in that language.
12. Null Object: Provides an object as a surrogate for the lack of an object of a given type.

## When to Use Behavioral Patterns:

* When you need to improve the flexibility, reusability, or maintainability of your code.
* When you want to decouple objects from each other.
* When you need to define different behaviors for objects based on their state.
* When you want to encapsulate a request as an object.
* When you need to provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially.
* When you need to define a one-to-many dependency between objects.
* When you need to define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable.
* When you need to define the skeleton of an algorithm and allow subclasses to override specific steps.
* When you need to perform operations on the elements of an object structure without exposing its internal representation.

## Benefits of Behavioral Patterns:

* Flexibility: Makes your code more adaptable to changes.
* Reusability: Promotes code reuse by encapsulating common interaction patterns.
* Maintainability: Improves the maintainability of your code.
* Decoupling: Decouples objects from each other, making your code easier to understand and modify.
* Consistency: Ensures consistent behavior across different objects.
