# Singleton Design Pattern

The Singleton design pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it. This pattern is useful for:

* Maintaining a single instance of an object: When only one object of a class is needed throughout the application (e.g., configuration manager, logger).
* Enforcing centralized control: Provides a central point to access and modify the state of the object.

## Benefits

* Global Access Point: Offers a single point of access to the singleton instance.
* Resource Efficiency: Prevents unnecessary object creation and improves memory usage.
* Controlled State: Enforces centralized control over the singleton's state.

## Implementation

* The Singleton design pattern follows these key principles:

1. Private Constructor: The constructor is made private to prevent direct object creation.
2. Static Instance: A static variable holds the single instance of the class.
3. Static Access Method: A static method provides access to the singleton instance. This method checks if the instance exists and creates it if not (lazy initialization) or returns the existing instance.
4. Thread Safety (Optional): If concurrent access is a concern, synchronization mechanisms (e.g., synchronized keyword in Java) are used to control access to the instance creation.

## Example
```java
public class Logger {

private static Logger instance; // Static instance

private Logger() {} // Private constructor

public static Logger getInstance() {
if (instance == null) {
synchronized (Logger.class) { // Thread safety for creation
if (instance == null) {
instance = new Logger();
}
}
}
return instance;
}

public void log(String message) {
// Implement logging logic
System.out.println("Log: " + message);
}
}

public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Logger logger1 = Logger.getInstance();
Logger logger2 = Logger.getInstance();


    // Both logger1 and logger2 will point to the same instance
                                          logger1.log("Hello from logger1");
                                          logger2.log("Hello from logger2");
}
}
```

```python
class ConfigurationManager:

_instance = None

def __new__(cls):
if not cls._instance:
cls._instance = super(ConfigurationManager, cls).__new__(cls) Â  

      # Initialize configuration here
                                                                 return cls._instance

def get_config(self, key):
# Implement logic to retrieve configuration value based on key
return "default_value"

# Usage
config_manager1 = ConfigurationManager()
config_manager2 = ConfigurationManager()

# Both config_manager1 and config_manager2 point to the same instance
print(config_manager1.get_config("api_key"))
print(config_manager2.get_config("database_url"))
```

Note:

The Python example uses the __new__ method to achieve singleton behavior.
Thread safety is not explicitly implemented in this example. Consider using locking mechanisms if concurrent access is a concern.
